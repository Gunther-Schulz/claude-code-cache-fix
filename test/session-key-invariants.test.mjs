// not travel to the sibling".
//
// This exact failure happened twice in one day (2026-07-28), the second time
// costing real cache:
//
//   insertion-normalization keyed persisted state on (session-id,
//   system-prompt). Every subagent of a session runs the same agent prompt,
//   so one bucket held 39 distinct conversations and 100% of conversation
//   switches within a bucket reset (60/60). Fixed by adding a conversation
//   sub-key: 0 resets across 940 requests.
//
//   deferred-tool-rewrite had the IDENTICAL key and did not get the fix,
//   because nothing connected the two. Its tool_addition announcement is
//   anchored to a MESSAGE IDENTITY, so under a shared key the stored anchor
//   belonged to another conversation's history, failed to match, and
//   re-anchored to "after the last user message" — a different index every
//   request. Measured: our output diverging at index 4 while CC's history was
//   byte-identical through index 23, twice in one corpus.
//
// A fix applied to one consumer of a shared idea is not applied. So this file
// does not test a list someone maintains: it DISCOVERS every exported
// `*SessionKey` function under proxy/extensions/ and holds all of them to the
// same invariants. A new stateful extension is covered the moment it exports
// one, and an existing one cannot quietly regress.
//
// If a future extension legitimately needs a coarser key, this test failing is
// the conversation about it — which is the point.
