// prefix-diff — diagnostic extension for hunting cache-bust sources.
//
// On every request, snapshots a projection of everything the prompt cache
// keys on and diffs it against the previous request's snapshot. Writes
// three artifacts under `~/.claude/cache-fix-snapshots/`:
//
//   <key>-last.json    latest snapshot (overwritten; the diff baseline)
//   <key>-diff.json    latest diff, full detail (overwritten)
//   <key>-events.jsonl append-only ledger, one bounded record per diff
//
// No request mutation. Fail-open: any I/O error is swallowed. Set
// CACHE_FIX_DEBUG=1 to also log swallowed errors.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Design notes — the four blind spots this version closes (2026-07-27)
//
// A resume-after-quit bust was traced to `system=DIFFER` and went no
// further: the tooling could say the system prompt changed but not which
// block, let alone which bytes. Investigating that turned up four ways
// the diagnostic could report nothing, or report something misleading,
// on exactly the events it exists to catch.
//
// 1. SELF-DEFEATING KEY. The session key was
//    `sha256(JSON.stringify(system).slice(0, 2000))` — derived from one
//    of the very things being diffed. A system-prompt change inside that
//    2000-char window changed the key, so the lookup missed the prior
//    snapshot, so NO diff was written and NO line was logged. The most
//    important bust class could vanish without a trace, and whether it
//    did came down to whether the changed bytes happened to sit before
//    or after char 2000. The key now comes from the request's session-id
//    header (`resolveSessionId`) — an identifier that cannot drift with
//    the content it indexes. The content hash remains only as a fallback
//    for requests without the header.
//
// 2. SELF-ERASING EVIDENCE. `<key>-diff.json` was a single fixed path
//    rewritten on every diff, so a bust's detail survived only until the
//    next one — minutes, in an active session. Post-mortems ran against
//    a file that had already been overwritten. The full-detail file
//    stays (it is the convenient "what just happened" view), but every
//    diff now also appends a bounded record to `<key>-events.jsonl`,
//    which is never rewritten in place.
//
// 3. NAME-ONLY TOOL HASHING. `toolsHash` hashed `tools.map(t => t.name)`.
//    Schema and description changes — MCP servers reconnecting with
//    revised definitions, a tool gaining a parameter — were invisible,
//    and `tools=match` was routinely reported for a tools array whose
//    bytes had changed. Tools are now hashed over their full JSON, with
//    a per-tool hash so a diff names the specific tool.
//
// 4. OPAQUE SYSTEM HASH. One hash over the whole system array answered
//    "did it change" and nothing else. Snapshots now store each block's
//    full text (capped), so a diff reports the changed block's index,
//    label, first differing character offset, and a context window from
//    both sides — byte-level evidence rather than a boolean.
//
// Two further gaps closed at the same time:
//   - TOP-LEVEL PARAMS (model, temperature, max_tokens, thinking, …)
//     were not snapshotted at all, yet a change to any of them changes
//     the cache key. A model switch mid-session read as "0 differences".
//   - MESSAGE-ARRAY MIDDLE. Head (5) + markers (8) + tail (3) windows
//     leave a long session's middle unobserved. Every message is now
//     hashed — cheap, ~40 bytes each — so the diff reports the exact
//     first divergent index regardless of where it lands. The three
//     windows remain, now as detail providers for the region the hash
//     chain points at.
//
// The organising rule, learned the hard way: the snapshot must cover
// everything the cache keys on, and the key under which it is stored
// must not be one of those things.
//
// Closing the diagnostic's own blind spots (2026-07-27, same day): the
// tool that hunts cache busts had three of its own. `output_config`
// (effort — "each effort level has its own cache"), `speed` (fast mode
// — adds a request header that is part of the cache key) and `betas`
// were body params TRACKED_PARAMS never listed, so an effort or
// fast-mode change read as "0 differences" the same way an untracked
// model switch used to. They're plain entries in TRACKED_PARAMS now;
// diffParams already deep-compares by JSON.stringify, so an object
// param like `output_config` (effort lives inside it) diffs correctly
// with no extra code. The fourth blind spot lived outside `ctx.body`
// entirely: the anthropic-beta REQUEST HEADER (e.g.
// context-1m-2025-08-07 — see auto-1m-guard.mjs, which exists because
// of exactly this header) is part of the cache key but was never
// snapshotted at all, so a beta-header-only bust — an effort/speed
// change never touches it either — was unattributable. `ctx.headers`
// reaches onRequest hooks (see pipeline.mjs's runOnRequest and every
// extension that reads `ctx.headers`), so the header is now snapshotted
// via auto-1m-guard's own `findBetaHeader`/`parseBetaTokens` and diffed
// as a normalized, sorted token set — order doesn't change the cache
// key, only membership does.

 * baseline per session, the diff compared each request against whichever
 * co-tenant happened to go last, so conversations advancing normally
 * rendered as violent prefix churn:
 *
 *     msgs: 80->82   (main advancing)
 *     msgs: 82->40   model: opus-5 -> sonnet-5   <- subagent's turn
 *     msgs: 40->43   (subagent advancing)
 *     msgs: 43->2    (a small background call)
 *
 * Nothing is wrong in that trace, but it reads as thrashing — and it was
 * read that way on 2026-07-27, as the cause of a 93k bust it had nothing
 * to do with (cache_read climbed straight through; nothing was evicted).
 * A diagnostic that manufactures false causes is worse than none, so each
 * tenant gets its own baseline — stored side by side under the SAME file
 * key, so nothing has to move. Same remedy insertion-normalization applies
 * to its persisted canonical (commit e0bb7f2).
 *
 * Identity comes from `x-claude-code-agent-id` when CC sets it — that is
 * authoritative and immune to prompt edits. It is often absent
 * (workflow-agent-id-synthesis.mjs exists precisely because CC omits it
 * for Workflow legs, CC#66761), so the fallback is the leading system
 * block, which identifies the agent ("You are an interactive agent…" vs a
 * subagent's brief) and is stable for a conversation's life.
 *
 * The fallback cannot be made exact: `workflow-agent-derivation.mjs:40-55`
 * establishes that CC keeps agentId/agentType/run-id in IN-PROCESS state,
 * never on the wire, and the Messages API has no slots for them. So a new
 * tenant and a mid-conversation system-prompt change are genuinely
 * indistinguishable from here; the read path below labels that case rather
 * than guessing, and keeps the evidence either way.
