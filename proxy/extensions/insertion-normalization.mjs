// insertion-normalization — re-serialize a mid-history splice back into
// arrival order so the prefix cache sees an append instead of a rewrite.
//
// Design: docs/directives/proxy-insertion-normalization.md (phase 2 of the
// the removed mid-history-breakpoint-ladder work). Implements the Design
// sketch rules 1-4 only; the "Alternative considered" (full marker
// ownership) section is explicitly NOT built here.
//
// Activation: `enabled: true` in extensions.json (always loaded), runtime
// gate CACHE_FIX_INSERTION_NORMALIZE=1 (opt-in, read per-call so tests can
// flip it without re-importing). CACHE_FIX_DEBUG honored for swallowed
// I/O errors, same idiom as prefix-diff.
//
// Order 395 — after read-dedupe (380), before cache-control-normalize
// (400), so the marker-placing pass sees the normalized order. (Two other
// marker placers once sat at 410 and 420; both were removed 2026-07-28 —
// see message-hash.mjs.)
// Verified-safe adjacent slot: read-dedupe only rewrites LATER duplicate
// occurrences of a Read tool_result (the first/keeper occurrence is never
// rewritten, and "keeper" is monotonic — a message that was already the
// earliest occurrence of its dedupe key stays the earliest occurrence as
// new messages arrive), so a message already recorded in canonical never
// has its content-hash change out from under it by running after
// read-dedupe. content-strip (330) and microcompact-stability (350) run
// even earlier, so their output is what canonical hashes see from the
// start — no special handling needed for those either.
//
// --- Canonical history model ---
//
// Per session (keyed off the session-id header, same derivation as
// prefix-diff post-fc432bf — SUB-KEYED additionally by a hash
// of the request's system prompt, see systemPromptSubKey/threat-matrix
// row 14: sidecar requests such as title-generation share the session-id
// header with the main thread but carry a different system prompt, so
// without the sub-key every sidecar turn thrashed the main thread's
// canonical back to reset), the proxy holds an append-only list of entry
// identity records: { h: contentHash, r: role, o: occurrence }.
// The hash is computed AFTER stripping cache_control (message-hash.mjs's
// hashMessageContent, imported rather than reimplemented) so a marker placed by a downstream extension never
// changes an entry's identity. `o` is a 0-based occurrence counter over
// (hash, role) pairs in array order, which disambiguates duplicate
// identical messages (directive's "Known risks to resolve").
//
// --- Classification ---
//
// On each request, canonical entries are matched into the incoming
// messages array by identity. Two things can go wrong with that match,
// and either one sends the request to rule 3 (passthrough + reset):
//   - some canonical entry has no matching identity in incoming (covers
//     true edits, removals, assistant-content changes, and a shrunk
//     history — a shorter incoming array can never contain every
//     canonical entry);
//   - the matched incoming indices are not strictly increasing (the
//     canonical order isn't preserved as a subsequence).
//
// If the match holds, incoming entries not matched into canonical are
// "new". New entries positioned AFTER every matched canonical index are
// ordinary tail growth (the ordinary shape of a conversation advancing —
// including a new assistant turn, which is expected and never restricted).
// New entries positioned AT OR BEFORE the last matched canonical index are
// the actual splice: content Claude Code inserted earlier than where it
// arrived. Rule 2 (INSERTION-ONLY) applies only to those:
//   - every such entry's role must not be "assistant" (the directive says
//     "user-role or system-role — never assistant"; this transport's
//     messages[] array only ever carries role "user" or "assistant" — the
//     system prompt is a separate top-level field, never a messages[]
//     entry — so this reduces to "must be role user". Surfaced as a GAP
//     rather than silently assumed away: see the closing report.);
//   - re-serializing (canonical order first, then ALL new entries —
//     spliced and tail alike — appended in their incoming relative order)
//     must not separate any tool_result-bearing user message from an
//     immediately-preceding assistant message carrying the matching
//     tool_use id(s).
//
// When both hold, the request is re-serialized and forwarded; canonical
// grows by appending the new entries' identities (in the same order they
// were appended to the message array). When either fails, or when the
// match itself failed, the request passes through UNCHANGED and canonical
// resets to a fresh identity list computed from incoming — one honest
// bust, per the directive's conservative bias.
//
// Note the re-serialization formula subsumes plain append: when every new
// entry is already tail growth, "canonical order + new entries appended
// in arrival order" reproduces incoming byte-for-byte. The two cases are
// told apart only for telemetry (action: "append-only" when nothing
// moved, "normalized" when a splice was detected and corrected).
//
// --- Phase 3: volatile-block pinning + removal tolerance (opt-in) ---
//
// Directive: docs/directives/proxy-volatile-block-pinning.md. Gated
// separately by CACHE_FIX_VOLATILE_PIN=1 so the phase-2 behavior above is
// byte-identical when the flag is off — the two modes even keep separate
// canonical identity math, and a canon file written under one mode is
// ignored by the other (one honest reset at the flag flip, never a
// mismatch).
//
// Pin mode changes two things, both measured on live traffic 2026-07-28:
//
// 1. FLIP ABSORPTION. CC serializes hook-injected additionalContext
//    <system-reminder> blocks nondeterministically for deep-history
//    messages — present in one request, absent from the next (two
//    attributed whole-context busts: 135k + 182k, both named by the
//    prevContent/nowContent capture). In pin mode a user message's
//    identity hash EXCLUDES volatile blocks (a text block that is
//    entirely a <system-reminder> wrap, or empty text — the observed
//    flip counterpart), so both serializations match the same canonical
//    entry, and the proxy forwards the FIRST-SEEN bytes: byte-stable
//    history, the flip never reaches the cache. Hard limits: user-role
//    only; text blocks only (tool_results are never volatile); a message
//    carrying a cache_control marker is never rewritten; a non-volatile
//    difference changes the identity hash and takes the reset path.
//
// 2. REMOVAL TOLERANCE. Same-tenant message-count shrinks are routine
//    (91 measured; context-management-2025-06-27 confirmed in the wire
//    beta set), and each one killed the phase-2 subsequence match —
//    reset-per-prune, degrading the extension to a no-op for the rest of
//    the session. In pin mode a canonical entry missing from incoming is
//    marked dropped (kept in the file, flagged, never forwarded) and the
//    match continues past the gap; order violations among SURVIVORS
//    remain a hard reset, and dropping more than half the live entries
//    resets too (that is a compaction, not a prune).
