# claude-code-cache-fix (fork) — open operational items

Proxy-domain parking. Deployment-side items (which gates run on which
machine, pins, acceptance records) live in the operator's dotfiles repo;
SYSTEM items — code, PRs, investigations, upstream threads — live here.
Fork-only file, excluded from PR slices like FORK-NOTES.md. One item per
bullet, evidence pointer included.

## Open

- **Upstream PR series #272–#281 (ten open, #281 draft) — await review.**
  Updated 2026-07-30 after the suppression work: #272 gained the
  duplicate-suppression commit (c713d0e), #276 the output-side
  metric/census/exemptions refresh (93203c9, extension synced to the
  #272 tip), #281 rebased onto c713d0e (draft, force-with-lease); all
  three commented, slices test-verified in their own worktrees.
  Rebase worktrees: `~/dev/vendor/cache-fix-pr{1..10}`. #281 flips to
  ready when #272 merges (either side can; `gh pr ready 281`). Residue
  riding with rebases or a final chore PR: +35 lines of test hardening
  (install-service / proxy-wrapper / read-dedupe tests) and
  proxy-restart-transparent.test.mjs. PR2's copy of
  session-key-invariants.test.mjs excises the prefix-diff tenantId case;
  it lives in #280's proxy-prefix-diff.test.mjs.

- **COMMITTED on PR #272 and #273 threads: week-of-soak summary, due
  ~2026-08-05.** Material: cache-fix-gate-status.json history + the
  worktime --cold ledger (preventable vs TTL-idle split).

- **Watch threads** for responses: anthropics/claude-code #76606,
  #81967, #78660 (our comments with measurements), #82229 (our issue),
  cnighswonger PRs #272–#281.

- **ECONNRESET on >200K cold contexts (CC#79989) — exposure noted,
  mitigation candidate.** This fleet runs the 1m beta at 700k+ contexts.
  If a session hard-fails every request after going cold, this is the
  first hypothesis; the candidate mitigation is a forward-path
  retry/backoff. Not built: no local occurrence yet (deferral basis:
  zero observed instances here — an occurrence is the build trigger,
  and the threat-matrix coverage section carries the class).

- **Row 2 (threat matrix): TTL keepalive** — OPEN since 2026-07-27,
  phase-3 candidate, cost-positive only if the operator returns after
  idle; needs idle-detection + opt-in. Unchanged.

- **Reminder-swap (#76606): DECIDED — pin-and-suppress (operator
  "B", 2026-07-29 evening).** Resolution history: fidelity probe
  proved replay byte-faithful to the wire; the "mitigated:true" had
  been the METRIC's blindness (input-side only), and the pipeline's
  real behavior is restore-the-pin AND forward the duplicate — a
  splice at 31 that re-billed 124k while carrying the reminder
  twice. (a) DONE: census blockMigration annotation (5cdf51b).
  (b) DONE: output-side metric (3db056b, pushed; dispatcher-verified
  under boot-record gates — flags exactly n=26->28, nowhere else in
  1190 requests). Residuals from its report, accepted with names:
  the real-pair test SKIPs (not fails) once the capture rotates —
  third motivating instance for "Harvest pins instances" above; and
  the metric newly exposes FIVE more output-spliced pairs (~0.6 MB,
  ordinals in the mitigation report) — classify against
  blockMigration after (c) lands, they may be a different mechanism.
  (c) DONE 2026-07-30 (c5d870d, sonnet build;
  dispatcher-verified: suites green, full-corpus gate 0/0/0/0 under
  boot-record gates, real pair edit@31 ~61 kB -> edit@48 ~5 kB).
  Two spec corrections booked from the build, both verified: the
  "declared exemption in the live output-guard" clause was written
  against a check that does not exist (output-guard has no
  message-count invariant BY DESIGN — its directive line 58; 0
  fires over 1190 requests) — no exemption owed; and the literal
  acceptance criterion "outputPreserved:true / rebilledOut 0" was
  unreachable by this fix alone — the residual divergence at 48 is
  ttl-management relocating its cache_control marker off the old
  tail (messages differ in ONLY that key, direct diff), expected
  behavior of a different extension. The stability gate needed the
  same declared exemption as the safety gate and the brief did not
  name it (67 false fires before the fix, caught by full-corpus
  replay) — lesson: a message-COUNT change gets checked against all
  four replay invariants, not the two a brief happens to name.
  Suppression is re-detected per request from the on-disk pin set
  (no new state file). Remaining, named: (1) DEPLOY — proxy/** ->
  dotfiles pin bump + restart at a stated session boundary + gate
  run (dev-loop); row 8 closes on the live non-event, not the
  build. (2) The five other output-spliced pairs are confirmed NOT
  block migrations (census post-fix: exactly 4, none of the five)
  — a different, still-unclassified mechanism, still open. (3) The
  three sibling migrations (n=105->107, 107->108, 108->109) were
  covered only by the aggregate gate, not individually verified.
  (4) grep for consumers of the new suppressed/suppressions stats
  fields not run (prior equivalent check on outputForm found none).

- **READY — replay warns on gateless runs of gated captures**
  (2026-07-29; was serialized behind the suppress build, now
  unblocked — tools/replay.mjs free). Design: replay.mjs already parses the boot
  record's `gates`; when the capture declares gates and none of them
  is set in the effective env, print one unmissable warning line
  ("replaying DEFAULT gates; this traffic was served with N gates —
  pass --env or use gate-live") on stderr and stamp the census
  header with the gate source. NOT a hard fail (deliberate gateless
  replays are legitimate A/B runs). Verifier: bite — gated capture +
  empty env → warning present; same capture with gates passed → no
  warning. Grounding: the same operator-side instrument error three
  times in ONE day (default-gates census booked a wrong matrix
  verdict; two verification reruns repeated it) with the dev-loop
  warning loaded each time — prose exhausted, mechanize the tell.

- **OPEN — deferred-tool-rewrite self-inflicted busts, pre-existing,
  surfaced by the 2026-07-30 gate run** (first red gate after the
  suppression deploy; the deploy is EXONERATED by A/B — the full
  pre-suppression tree replays s-dc3f8071 with the same 25 stability
  violations). Evidence: s-dc3f8071 (yesterday's live traffic,
  472 MB, last write 19:47 — first time gated), 25 violations all
  `inDiv=append-only outDiv=1 [CC bytes IDENTICAL -> ours]
  <- deferred-tool-rewrite`, burst-shaped (n=372->375 within one
  second): CC appended cleanly while OUR announcement message at
  index 1 flapped across consecutive requests = real live busts that
  session paid. The tool_addition announcement is supposed to change
  once per addition, not oscillate. Also 10 unparseable capture
  lines, same capture, unexplained. s-58c979ce carries 1 more
  violation (attribution run pending at booking time). Investigate:
  why the announcement flaps under burst traffic (suspects:
  per-request tools[] churn from parallel subagents, MCP server
  set differing per request); candidate connection, unverified: the
  five unclassified output-spliced pairs in s-633915a8. The second
  red capture is a DIFFERENT class: s-58c979ce n=2024->2025
  (12:31:18Z, pre-deploy traffic), 1 violation, `inDiv=1 outDiv=0
  [CC bytes IDENTICAL -> ours] <- fresh-session-sort` — CC's input
  changed at index 1, our output byte-flapped at index 0; not
  suppression-shaped (byte change, not message removal), one
  instance in ~2000 requests. The gate stays red until these are
  understood or the classes exempted with a basis — do NOT treat
  red as noise (the check fired on real defects; that is it
  working).

## From the closing-gate sweep (2026-07-29, opus dispatch) — parked with bases

- **Orphan telemetry consumers (Q4).** Alarm files written by ON gates
  that nothing reads: `guard-events.jsonl` (output-guard restores),
  `upstream-changes.jsonl` (row 5's alarm), insertion/deferred event
  logs, session mirrors; plus status-file fields (`gateSource`,
  `fidelityMutated*`) and boot-record `proxyTree`. Design ONE consumer
  pattern (likely: more shape-verdicts entries reading each file's
  recency + alarm count) rather than N bespoke checks. Deferral basis:
  consumer DESIGN per file is judgment work (which absence fails, which
  warns), not a mechanical port. Effort M.
- **Harvest pins instances, not only classes (Q2).** Fixtures bank one
  exemplar per CLASS; the evidence behind specific verdicts (row 4's
  distribution on s-58c979ce, acceptance strings citing s-538c0aef)
  still rots with rotation. Spec sketch: `harvest --pin <key> <n..m>`
  freezes a sanitized range as a named fixture; matrix rows and
  acceptance strings then cite fixtures, not capture keys. Effort M.
- **Row 6's isolating query is built and unread (Q3).** findToolsDeltas
  emits exactly the tools-only classification row 6 says "cannot be run
  as-is". With --census now on every sweep, read the answer off the
  next gate status and update row 6. Effort S, blocked on one timer run.
- **Duplicate-request probe → census check (Q1).** The #78420 falsifier
  (adjacent byte-identical bodies) was a throwaway python scan; as a
  census counter it re-answers daily. Effort S.
- **upstream-error-log gate ON? (operator decision.)** CC#79989's named
  first-hypothesis alarm exists in-tree and is OFF. Needs the standard
  acceptance probe before flipping — a gate flip without one is the
  class the roster check exists for.
- **resolveCaptureKey pools literal "empty" (79 requests).** A capture
  keying change = state-KEY change (threat matrix row 3): belongs at a
  session boundary, stated before the restart. Not urgent — the pooled
  requests are keyless utility calls.

## Parked decisions

- **Repo location `~/dev/vendor/` — LEAVE for now** (operator + session
  2026-07-29). The fork is operator-owned (taxonomy says
  `~/dev/Gunther-Schulz/`), but a move touches the serving unit's
  ExecStart, HTTPS_PROXY env, manifest paths, repos.tsv, and ten live
  PR worktrees' gitdir pointers — coordinated migration for purely
  taxonomic gain. Revisit trigger: PR series merged and worktrees
  removed (the natural cheap moment).

- **Resume-boundary attribution — BUILT the day it was parked**
  (operator push; findSuccessions in tools/replay.mjs, census-gated,
  rides the daily sweep): compaction/resume/fork boundary classes with
  opener pricing; interleaves structurally suppressed (never-returns +
  first-appearance conditions — the one-shot-sidecar phantom was caught
  by the class's own bite). Validated pair-for-pair against the hand
  probe on s-0edbd11c (9de68b3).

- **Census system-delta class — candidate, not built** (2026-07-29).
  Within-session inflation instruments: tools[] churn is classified
  (findToolsDeltas, counts + forwardedStable); SYSTEM deltas are only
  observed live (prefix-diff cause lines) and preserved in captures —
  censusPair classifies messages only, so an offline "how often / how
  expensive are mid-session system changes" question has no census
  answer today. Deliberately not built: no such question is currently
  unanswered (prefix-diff logs + matrix row 5 cover the known classes).
  Build trigger: the first system-delta question that needs an offline
  answer over a corpus — then a census kind beside toolsDeltas, same
  shape.
