# claude-code-cache-fix (fork) — open operational items

Proxy-domain parking. Deployment-side items (which gates run on which
machine, pins, acceptance records) live in the operator's dotfiles repo;
SYSTEM items — code, PRs, investigations, upstream threads — live here.
Fork-only file, excluded from PR slices like FORK-NOTES.md. One item per
bullet, evidence pointer included.

## Open

- **Upstream PR series #272–#281 (ten open, #281 draft) — await review.**
  Rebase worktrees: `~/dev/vendor/cache-fix-pr{1..10}`. #281 flips to
  ready when #272 merges (either side can; `gh pr ready 281`). Residue
  riding with rebases or a final chore PR: +35 lines of test hardening
  (install-service / proxy-wrapper / read-dedupe tests) and
  proxy-restart-transparent.test.mjs. PR2's copy of
  session-key-invariants.test.mjs excises the prefix-diff tenantId case;
  it lives in #280's proxy-prefix-diff.test.mjs.

- **COMMITTED on PR #272 and #273 threads: week-of-soak summary, due
  ~2026-08-05.** Material: cache-fix-gate-status.json history + the
  worktime --cold ledger (preventable vs TTL-idle split).

- **Watch threads** for responses: anthropics/claude-code #76606,
  #81967, #78660 (our comments with measurements), #82229 (our issue),
  cnighswonger PRs #272–#281.

- **ECONNRESET on >200K cold contexts (CC#79989) — exposure noted,
  mitigation candidate.** This fleet runs the 1m beta at 700k+ contexts.
  If a session hard-fails every request after going cold, this is the
  first hypothesis; the candidate mitigation is a forward-path
  retry/backoff. Not built: no local occurrence yet (deferral basis:
  zero observed instances here — an occurrence is the build trigger,
  and the threat-matrix coverage section carries the class).

- **Row 2 (threat matrix): TTL keepalive** — OPEN since 2026-07-27,
  phase-3 candidate, cost-positive only if the operator returns after
  idle; needs idle-detection + opt-in. Unchanged.
